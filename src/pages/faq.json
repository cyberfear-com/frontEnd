        "question": "Is Mailum safer than Gmail?",
        "answer": "Yes, Mailum is safer than Gmail. Mailum employs end-to-end encryption and zero-access encryption, meaning that only you and your intended recipients can read your emails. Even Mailum cannot access your emails. In contrast, Gmail retains the decryption keys for your data on the same servers where it stores your messages, allowing Gmail to read your emails or hand them over to authorities if requested. This lack of zero-access encryption also puts you at greater risk in the event of a data breach. Mailumâ€™s robust encryption practices provide an additional layer of security, making it a much safer choice for your email needs."

Our free plan allows you to experience the benefits of end-to-end encryption and zero-access encryption without any cost. For those looking for additional features, such as more storage, multiple email addresses, custom email domains, and unlimited outgoing messages, we offer various paid plans. Upgrading to a paid plan also supports our mission to create a better internet where privacy is the default."

        "question": "How can email alias help me?",
        "answer": "Email aliases can greatly enhance your online privacy and organization. By creating multiple email aliases under your main Mailum account, you can use different email addresses for various purposes, such as online shopping, newsletters, or personal correspondence, without revealing your primary email address. This helps protect your main inbox from spam and phishing attacks. Additionally, aliases can simplify managing and sorting your emails, as you can easily filter messages based on the alias they were sent to. Using email aliases is an effective way to maintain privacy, reduce clutter, and streamline your email management."
